# Watchwyrd Brand Guidelines

## 1. Brand Overview

**Watchwyrd** is an **AI-powered Stremio addon** that provides highly personalized and contextual movie and TV series recommendations. The name is a portmanteau of "Watch" (for viewing content) and "Wyrd" (an Old English concept roughly equivalent to fate or destiny), reflecting the core value proposition: **Your viewing fate, revealed.**

The brand is positioned at the intersection of **mysticism/fate** and **cutting-edge AI technology**. It is designed to feel intelligent, personalized, and a little bit magical.

| Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Brand Name** | Watchwyrd |
| **Tagline** | Your viewing fate, revealed. |
| **Core Value** | Highly accurate, contextual, and personalized media recommendations. |
| **Brand Personality** | Intelligent, Mystical, Futuristic, Personalized, Trustworthy. |
| **Target Audience** | Tech-savvy media consumers, Stremio users, AI enthusiasts, and those seeking to discover "hidden gems" beyond mainstream algorithms. |

## 2. Visual Identity

### 2.1. Logo

The primary logo is based on **Concept 1**, which features a stylized **crystal ball** with a glowing **eye** and a **play button** at its center. This design perfectly encapsulates the brand's dual nature: the mystical "wyrd" (crystal ball/eye) and the media/technology focus (play button).

**Primary Logo:**
*   **Concept:** Crystal Ball with Play Button Eye
*   **Colors:** Deep Indigo, Cosmic Purple, Neon Cyan.
*   **Usage:** Use on all primary branding, website headers, and high-visibility placements.

**App Icon/Favicon:**
*   A simplified, high-gloss version of the crystal ball icon, suitable for small-scale use.

### 2.2. Color Palette

The color palette is inspired by the cosmos, deep space, and neon digital interfaces, creating a sense of mystery and high-tech sophistication.

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Indigo** | `#191970` | Primary background, text, and dark mode elements. |
| **Cosmic Purple** | `#4B0082` | Secondary color, gradients, and mystical elements. |
| **Neon Cyan** | `#00FFFF` | Accent color, highlights, call-to-action buttons, and digital glow effects. |
| **Deep Violet** | `#8A2BE2` | Supporting color for gradients and depth. |
| **Pure White** | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark backgrounds, clean contrast. |

### 2.3. Typography

The typography should balance the mystical and the modern. A clean, geometric sans-serif font is recommended for readability and a futuristic feel.

*   **Primary Font (Headlines):** A bold, geometric sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins) to convey a modern, strong presence.
*   **Secondary Font (Body Text):** A highly readable, clean sans-serif (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans) for all body copy and interface text.

## 3. Imagery and Graphics

Imagery should focus on the blend of **cinematic elements** and **digital/AI concepts**.

*   **Themes:** Nebulas, constellations, digital networks, film strips, futuristic interfaces, and subtle magical/mystical elements (e.g., glowing light, smoke).
*   **Style:** Dark, rich backgrounds with vibrant, glowing accents (Neon Cyan, Cosmic Purple) to make content pop.
*   **Example Assets:**
    *   **Banner:** A cosmic background with film strips and glowing AI nodes.
    *   **Social Media:** Graphics showing movie posters being "divined" by a central, glowing orb.

## 4. Tone of Voice

The brand's voice should be **confident, intelligent, and slightly evocative**.

*   **Do:** Use terms like "divine," "revealed," "contextual," "personalized," "state-of-the-art," and "deeply intelligent."
*   **Don't:** Use overly casual or overly technical jargon. Maintain a professional yet engaging tone.
*   **Example Copy:**
    *   *Instead of:* "We use AI to find movies."
    *   *Use:* "**Watchwyrd** leverages state-of-the-art language models to divine your perfect viewing experience."
    *   *Instead of:* "It knows what time it is."
    *   *Use:* "Experience **Context-Aware** recommendations that know if it's a lazy Sunday morning or a Friday night blockbuster."
